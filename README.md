# PHSX815_Project1

This repository contains two scripts named:
1. Dice_Rolls.py
2. Dice_Rolls_Analysis.py

The first script throws 4 dice with biased and unbiased scenarios and saves data in a text file "Dice_Rolls_Data.txt"
The second script reads those data and performs a few statistical analysis and along the way makes some plots. There is a possibility that the read portion might not recognize the variables from .txt file if your system is not configured to read such files. In that case make sure to comment lines from 18 to 32 and uncomment line 5. 

## Usage

The scripts are fairly easy to run from a terminal:
1. python Dice_Rolls.py
2. python Dice_Rolls_Analysis.py
